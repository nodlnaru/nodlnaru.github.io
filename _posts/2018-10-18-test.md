# Mac OSX: can't start Git after updating Mac OS/XCode

I tried the proposed solution and got the following error:

xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance
Here is what you need to do:

Download Xcode through the AppStore, if you don't have it.
sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license
